single-sand
===========

# Intro

SingleSand is an experimental project which maps the idea of single-threaded
processing to a set of popular tools which together help to build asychronous,
scalable, simple and powerful applications.
It is fully based on C# async programming model therefore can act as a base for
most async applications as well as a bridge between different application layers,
see list of samples below.

# The goal

**Code simplicity over vertical scalability.** The main advantage of
single-threading model is absence of synchronization taht results in
code simplicity. On the other hand, it reduces the vertical scalability
but does not affect horizontal scalability. Since the horizontal
scalability is much more preferred in distributes systems, it's not a con.
